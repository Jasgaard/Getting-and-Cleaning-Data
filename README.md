This is the README.md file that contains information on how the script works.

The Purpose of this script is taken from the Course Porject Assignment and is listed directly below:

Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.List item
 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
 5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
 
----------
